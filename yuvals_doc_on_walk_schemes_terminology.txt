if we focus on this walk scheme:
Country@target-Code@country>Code@country-Country1@borders>borders

"@" - means "at" - for example: Country@target means the column Country at the table target 
"-" - means "to" - for example: Country@target-Code@country means the FK transition from table target to table country using the FK Country-Code
">" - means "seperation between 2 random walks"
